# Gale-Shapley-Implementation
# Elaine Prarthona Nelson

This is my version to implement the Gale-Shapley Algorithm. This was an optional project I did for my COMP 3600 (Algorithm Design and Analysis) course.

1. The random instance generator creates a file in the 'sampleinput.txt' format
2. This file is later taken as an input to 'galeshapley.py' to produce an output file of matches, in the format similar to 'sampleoutput.txt'
3. 'gstest.py' is a file used to test the running time of the code without the tedious process of converting the input file to arrays
